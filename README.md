The Model Zoo of Cognitive Diagnosis Models, including classic Item Response Ranking (**IRT**), Multidimensional Item Response Ranking (**MIRT**), Deterministic Input, Noisy "And" model(**DINA**), and advanced Fuzzy Cognitive Diagnosis Framework (**FuzzyCDF**), Neural Cognitive Diagnosis Model (**NCDM**), Item Response Ranking framework (**IRR**), Incremental Cognitive Diagnosis (**ICD**) and Knowledge-association baesd extension of NeuralCD (**KaNCD**).

## Brief introduction to CDM

Cognitive diagnosis model (CDM) for intelligent educational systems is a type of  model that infers students' knowledge states from their learning behaviors (especially exercise response logs). 



Typically, the input of a CDM could be the students' response logs of items (i.e., exercises/questions), the Q-matrix that denotes the correlation between items and knowledge concepts (skills). The output is the diagnosed student knowledge states, such as students' abilities and students' proficiencies on each knowledge concepts.



Traditional CDMs include:

- [IRT](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-89976-3): item response theory, a continuous unidimensional CDM with logistic-like item response function.
- [MIRT](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-89976-3): Multidimensional item response theory, a continuous multidimensional CDM with logistic-like item response function. Mostly extended from unidimensional IRT.
- [DINA](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3102/1076998607309474): deterministic input, noisy "and" model, a discrete multidimensional CDM. Q-matrix is used to model the effect of knowledge concepts in the cognitive process, as well as guessing and slipping factors.

etc.

More recent researches about CDMs:

- [FuzzyCDF](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~qiliuql/files/Publications/Qi-Liu-TIST2018.pdf): fuzzy cognitive diagnosis framework, a continuous multidimensional CDM for students' cognitive modeling with both objective and subjective items.
- [NeuralCD](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~cheneh/paper_pdf/2020/Fei-Wang-AAAI.pdf): neural cognitive diagnosis framework, a neural-network-based general cognitive diagnosis framework. In this repository we provide the basic implementation NCDM.
- [IRR](http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~tongsw/files/IRR.pdf): item response ranking framework, a pairwise cognitive diagnosis framework. In this repository we provide the several implementations for most of CDMs.
- [ICD]: Incremental Cognitive Diagnosis, a framework that tailor cognitive diagnosis into the online scenario of intelligent education. In this repository we provide the several implementations for most of CDMs.
- [KaNCD](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9865139): extended from the NeuralCD framework. We use high-order latent traits of students, exercises and knowledge concepts to capture latent associations among knowledge concepts.
